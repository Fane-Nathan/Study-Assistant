# Core Data Processing & RAG
numpy
nltk
scikit-learn # For cosine_similarity in recommender
tenacity # For retries in API calls
python-dotenv # For loading .env files (API keys etc)

# Embeddings & LLMs (Choose based on config.py)
google-generativeai # For Gemini API (LLM & Embeddings)
google-cloud-aiplatform # For Vertex AI Embeddings (if configured)
# sentence-transformers # Needed if using embedding_model_manual.py
# tensorflow # Needed if using embedding_model_manual.py or TF features
# torch # Often needed by sentence-transformers

# Data Fetching & Crawling
arxiv
requests
aiohttp # For async web requests in resource_fetcher.py
beautifulsoup4 # For HTML parsing
PyMuPDF # For PDF parsing (imported as fitz)
# PyPDF2 # Alternative/Legacy PDF library, keep if specifically used
readability-lxml # For HTML content extraction (depends on lxml)
lxml # Explicit dependency for readability-lxml
trafilatura # For advanced HTML text extraction
cachetools # For caching fetched resources
pybloom-live # For the Bloom filter in the crawler's visited set

# Keyword Search
rank_bm25 # For BM25 indexing

# Utilities & Other Potential Dependencies
huggingface_hub # Often used with transformers/tokenizers
tokenizers # Often used with transformers
transformers # The main Hugging Face library, keep if using related models/features
semanticscholar # If using its API
groq # If using Groq LLM API
prometheus-client # For metrics in resource_fetcher

# Web Framework (Optional - if you have a separate API)
fastapi[all]
uvicorn[standard]

# Streamlit UI (Uncomment if running app.py)
streamlit
altair # Often used with Streamlit for charts (imported in annotated_transformer example)
pandas # Often used with Streamlit/altair


# Notes:
# - Consider pinning specific versions (e.g., google-generativeai==0.8.4) for better reproducibility.
# - Remove sections (like tensorflow, groq, fastapi) if you are certain they are not needed for your final deployment target.
