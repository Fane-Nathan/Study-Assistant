Despite these successes, the attention mechanism of Transformers is associated with two well-known issues: rank-collapse and gradient vanishing. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis that it is inherently difficult to address both issues simultaneously in the conventional attention mechanism. To handle these issues, we introduce a novel class of attention mechanism, referred to as generalized probabilistic attention mechanism (GPAM), and its dual-attention implementation within the Transformer architecture. Unlike conventional attention mechanisms, GPAM allows for negative attention scores while preserving a fixed total sum.",

Our results suggest that NAS is highly effective on this task, and it identifies the best attention mechanisms for IMDb byte level text classification and Listops. We then extend our framework to search for and build Transformers with multiple different attention types, and call them heterogeneous Transformers.",

Yet, Graph Transformers are capable of modeling full range dependencies but are often deficient in extracting information from locality.

In this paper, we present a purely attention-based architecture, namely Focal and Full-Range Graph Transformer (FFGT), which can mitigate the loss of local information in learning global correlations.

The agent tokens first act as the agent for the query tokens $Q$ to aggregate information from $K$ and $V$, and then broadcast the information back to $Q$.",

Given the number of agent tokens can be designed to be much smaller than the number of query tokens, the agent attention is significantly more efficient than the widely adopted Softmax attention, while preserving global context modelling capability. Interestingly, we show that the proposed agent attention is equivalent to a generalized form of linear attention. Therefore, agent attention seamlessly integrates the powerful Softmax attention and the highly efficient linear attention.

In this paper, we introduce a novel Reuse Attention mechanism, tailored for efficient memory access and computational optimization, enabling seamless operation on resource-constrained platforms without compromising performance. Unlike traditional multi-head attention (MHA), which redundantly computes separate attention matrices for each head, Reuse Attention consolidates these computations into a shared attention matrix, significantly reducing memory overhead and computational complexity. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and downstream tasks show that the proposed UniForm models leveraging Reuse Attention achieve state-of-the-art imagenet classification accuracy while outperforming existing attention mechanisms, such as Linear Attention and Flash Attention, in inference speed and memory scalability.

Many methods limit the range of attention within a local window to reduce computation complexity. However, their approaches cannot save the number of parameters; meanwhile, the self-attention and inner position bias (inside the softmax function) cause each query to focus on similar and close patches. Consequently, this paper presents a light self-limited-attention (LSLA) consisting of a light self-attention mechanism (LSA) to save the computation cost and the number of parameters, and a self-limited-attention mechanism (SLA) to improve the performance.

However, deeper Transformer architectures frequently misalign with autoregressive objectives, obscuring the underlying VAR structure embedded within linear attention and hindering their ability to capture the data generative processes in TSF. In this work, we first show that a single linear attention layer can be interpreted as a dynamic vector autoregressive (VAR) structure. We then explain that existing multi-layer Transformers have structural mismatches with the autoregressive forecasting objective, which impair interpretability and generalization ability. To address this, we show that by rearranging the MLP, attention, and input-output flow, multi-layer linear attention can also be aligned as a VAR model.",

Although their performance has been greatly enhanced through highly descriptive patch embeddings and hierarchical structures, there is still limited research on utilizing additional data representations so as to refine the selfattention map of a Transformer. To address this problem, a novel attention mechanism, called multi-manifold multihead attention, is proposed in this work to substitute the vanilla self-attention of a Transformer. The proposed mechanism models the input space in three distinct manifolds, namely Euclidean, Symmetric Positive Definite and Grassmann, thus leveraging different statistical and geometrical properties of the input for the computation of a highly descriptive attention map.

We avoid this problem altogether by employing a transformer to encode a sequence of patches as a single global representation, which by design considers interdependencies between patches. We rely on various attention mechanisms -- first with self-attention within the Transformer, and second with channel attention within our difference modulation network -- specifically to reveal and enhance the more salient features throughout our architecture.",

To remedy this, we propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution Attention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms of time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head attention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual information in a coarse-to-fine fashion.

We show that stack attention is analogous to standard attention, but with a latent model of syntax that requires no syntactic supervision. We propose two variants: one related to deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and one based on nondeterministic PDAs, which allows transformers to recognize arbitrary CFLs.

Recently, various efficient attention architectures have been proposed to improve transformer's efficiency while largely preserving its efficacy, especially in modeling long sequences. A widely-used benchmark to test these efficient methods' capability on long-range modeling is Long Range Arena (LRA). However, LRA only focuses on the standard bidirectional (or noncausal) self attention, and completely ignores cross attentions and unidirectional (or causal) attentions, which are equally important to downstream applications. In this paper, we propose Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self, noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions.",

Transformers models have recently addressed this issue by incorporating an attention mechanism that assigns greater attention (i.e., relevance) scores to some words than others. Because of the attention mechanism's high computational cost, transformer models usually have an input-length limitation caused by hardware constraints. This limitation applies to many transformers, including the well-known bidirectional encoder representations of the transformer (BERT) model.

In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformers can generalize well to 3D atomistic graphs and present Equiformer, a graph neural network leveraging the strength of Transformer architectures and incorporating SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant features based on irreducible representations (irreps). First, we propose a simple and effective architecture by only replacing original operations in Transformers with their equivariant counterparts and including tensor products.

In this paper, we present an approach to learning a hard retrieval attention where an attention head only attends to one token in the sentence rather than all tokens. The matrix multiplication between attention probabilities and the value sequence in the standard scaled dot-product attention can thus be replaced by a simple and efficient retrieval operation.
